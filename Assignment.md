## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

 **four key concepts or skills I learned** 

- **Branching**: Helped me separate features and prevent conflicts when working on different sections of the site.
- **Milestones and issues**: Learnt and understood the importance of project management
- **Commit Messages:** Using clear commit messages made it easy to track the purpose of each change.
- **Pull Requests:** Allowed me to review my changes and simulate a real-world workflow before merging.
- **Merge Conflict Resolution:** I encountered a conflict while adding my image and resolved it by editing HTML manually and using Git commands.(I mostly learnt from some mistakes I was making)
